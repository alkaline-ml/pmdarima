class ARIMA(BaseEstimator):
    """An ARIMA estimator.

    An ARIMA, or autoregressive integrated moving average, is a
    generalization of an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and is fitted to
    time-series data in an effort to forecast future points. ARIMA models can
    be especially efficacious in cases where data shows evidence of
    non-stationarity.

    The "AR" part of ARIMA indicates that the evolving variable of interest is
    regressed on its own lagged (i.e., prior observed) values. The "MA" part
    indicates that the regression error is actually a linear combination of
    error terms whose values occurred contemporaneously and at various times
    in the past. The "I" (for "integrated") indicates that the data values
    have been replaced with the difference between their values and the
    previous values (and this differencing process may have been performed
    more than once). The purpose of each of these features is to make the model
    fit the data as well as possible.

    Non-seasonal ARIMA models are generally denoted ``ARIMA(p,d,q)`` where
    parameters ``p``, ``d``, and ``q`` are non-negative integers, ``p`` is the
    order (number of time lags) of the autoregressive model, ``d`` is the
    degree of differencing (the number of times the data have had past values
    subtracted), and ``q`` is the order of the moving-average model. Seasonal
    ARIMA models are usually denoted ``ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)m``, where ``m``
    refers to the number of periods in each season, and the uppercase ``P``,
    ``D``, ``Q`` refer to the autoregressive, differencing, and moving average
    terms for the seasonal part of the ARIMA model.

    When two out of the three terms are zeros, the model may be referred to
    based on the non-zero parameter, dropping "AR", "I" or "MA" from the
    acronym describing the model. For example, ``ARIMA(1,0,0)`` is ``AR(1)``,
    ``ARIMA(0,1,0)`` is ``I(1)``, and ``ARIMA(0,0,1)`` is ``MA(1)``. [1]

    See notes for more practical information on the ``ARIMA`` class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    order : iterable or array-like, shape=(3,)
        The (p,d,q) order of the model for the number of AR parameters,
        differences, and MA parameters to use. ``p`` is the order (number of
        time lags) of the auto-regressive model, and is a non-negative integer.
        ``d`` is the degree of differencing (the number of times the data have
        had past values subtracted), and is a non-negative integer. ``q`` is
        the order of the moving-average model, and is a non-negative integer.

    seasonal_order : array-like, shape=(4,), optional (default=None)
        The (P,D,Q,s) order of the seasonal component of the model for the
        AR parameters, differences, MA parameters, and periodicity. ``D`` must
        be an integer indicating the integration order of the process, while
        ``P`` and ``Q`` may either be an integers indicating the AR and MA
        orders (so that all lags up to those orders are included) or else
        iterables giving specific AR and / or MA lags to include. ``S`` is an
        integer giving the periodicity (number of periods in season), often it
        is 4 for quarterly data or 12 for monthly data. Default is no seasonal
        effect.

    start_params : array-like, optional (default=None)
        Starting parameters for ``ARMA(p,q)``.  If None, the default is given
        by ``ARMA._fit_start_params``.

    transparams : bool, optional (default=True)
        Whehter or not to transform the parameters to ensure stationarity.
        Uses the transformation suggested in Jones (1980).  If False,
        no checking for stationarity or invertibility is done.

    method : str, one of {'css-mle','mle','css'}, optional (default=None)
        This is the loglikelihood to maximize.  If "css-mle", the
        conditional sum of squares likelihood is maximized and its values
        are used as starting values for the computation of the exact
        likelihood via the Kalman filter.  If "mle", the exact likelihood
        is maximized via the Kalman Filter.  If "css" the conditional sum
        of squares likelihood is maximized.  All three methods use
        `start_params` as starting parameters.  See above for more
        information. If fitting a seasonal ARIMA, the default is 'lbfgs'

    trend : str or iterable, optional (default='c')
        Parameter controlling the deterministic trend polynomial :math:`A(t)`.
        Can be specified as a string where 'c' indicates a constant (i.e. a
        degree zero component of the trend polynomial), 't' indicates a
        linear trend with time, and 'ct' is both. Can also be specified as an
        iterable defining the polynomial as in ``numpy.poly1d``, where
        ``[1,1,0,1]`` would denote :math:`a + bt + ct^3`.

    solver : str or None, optional (default='lbfgs')
        Solver to be used.  The default is 'lbfgs' (limited memory
        Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno).  Other choices are 'bfgs',
        'newton' (Newton-Raphson), 'nm' (Nelder-Mead), 'cg' -
        (conjugate gradient), 'ncg' (non-conjugate gradient), and
        'powell'. By default, the limited memory BFGS uses m=12 to
        approximate the Hessian, projected gradient tolerance of 1e-8 and
        factr = 1e2. You can change these by using kwargs.

    maxiter : int, optional (default=50)
        The maximum number of function evaluations. Default is 50.

    disp : int, optional (default=0)
        If True, convergence information is printed.  For the default
        'lbfgs' ``solver``, disp controls the frequency of the output during
        the iterations. disp < 0 means no output in this case.

    callback : callable, optional (default=None)
        Called after each iteration as callback(xk) where xk is the current
        parameter vector. This is only used in non-seasonal ARIMA models.

    suppress_warnings : bool, optional (default=False)
        Many warnings might be thrown inside of statsmodels. If
        ``suppress_warnings`` is True, all of these warnings will be squelched.

    out_of_sample_size : int, optional (default=0)
        The number of examples from the tail of the time series to hold out
        and use as validation examples. The model will not be fit on these
        samples, but the observations will be added into the model's ``endog``
        and ``exog`` arrays so that future forecast values originate from the
        end of the endogenous vector. See :func:`add_new_observations`.

        For instance::

            y = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
            out_of_sample_size = 2

            > Fit on: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
            > Score on: [5, 6]
            > Append [5, 6] to end of self.arima_res_.data.endog values

    scoring : str, optional (default='mse')
        If performing validation (i.e., if ``out_of_sample_size`` > 0), the
        metric to use for scoring the out-of-sample data. One of {'mse', 'mae'}

    scoring_args : dict, optional (default=None)
        A dictionary of key-word arguments to be passed to the
        ``scoring`` metric.

    Notes
    -----
    * Since the ``ARIMA`` class currently wraps
      ``statsmodels.tsa.arima_model.ARIMA``, which does not provide support
      for seasonality, the only way to fit seasonal ARIMAs is to manually
      lag/pre-process your data appropriately. This might change in
      the future. [2]

    * After the model fit, many more methods will become available to the
      fitted model (i.e., :func:`pvalues`, :func:`params`, etc.). These are
      delegate methods which wrap the internal ARIMA results instance.
