    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array-like, shape=(n_samples,)
        The time series vector.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np

    >>> y = np.ones(3)
    >>> [is_constant(x), is_constant(y)]

    """Estimate the seasonal differencing term, ``D``.

    Perform a test of seasonality for different levels of ``D`` to
    estimate the number of seasonal differences required to make a given time
    series stationary. Will select the maximum value of ``D`` for which
    the time series is judged seasonally stationary by the statistical test.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array-like, shape=(n_samples, [n_features])
        The array to difference.

    m : int
        The number of seasonal periods (i.e., frequency of the
        time series)

    max_D : int, optional (default=2)
        Maximum number of seasonal differences allowed. Must
        be a positive integer. The estimated value of ``D`` will not
        exceed ``max_D``.

    test : str, optional (default='ocsb')
        Type of unit root test of seasonality to use in order
        to detect seasonal periodicity. Valid tests include ("ocsb", "ch").
        Note that the CHTest is very slow for large data.

    Returns
    -------
    D : int
        The estimated seasonal differencing term. This is the maximum value
        of ``D`` such that ``D <= max_D`` and the time series is judged
        seasonally stationary. If the time series is constant, will return 0.

    Perform a test of stationarity for different levels of ``d`` to
    estimate the number of differences required to make a given time
    series stationary. Will select the maximum value of ``d`` for which
    the time series is judged stationary by the statistical test.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array-like, shape=(n_samples, [n_features])
        The array (time series) to difference.

    alpha : float, optional (default=0.05)
        Level of the test. This is the value above below which the P-value
        will be deemed significant.

    test : str, optional (default='kpss')
        Type of unit root test of stationarity to use in order to
        test the stationarity of the time-series. One of ('kpss', 'adf', 'pp')

    max_d : int, optional (default=2)
        Maximum number of non-seasonal differences allowed. Must
        be a positive integer. The estimated value of ``d`` will not
        exceed ``max_d``.

    Returns
    -------
    d : int
        The estimated differencing term. This is the maximum value of ``d``
        such that ``d <= max_d`` and the time series is judged stationary.
        If the time series is constant, will return 0.
