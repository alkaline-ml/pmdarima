    Creates train/test splits over endogenous arrays an optional exogenous
    arrays. This is a wrapper of scikit-learn's ``train_test_split`` that
    does not shuffle.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *arrays : sequence of indexables with same length / shape[0]
        Allowed inputs are lists, numpy arrays, scipy-sparse
        matrices or pandas dataframes.

    test_size : float, int or None, optional (default=None)
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion
        of the dataset to include in the test split. If int, represents the
        absolute number of test samples. If None, the value is set to the
        complement of the train size. If ``train_size`` is also None, it will
        be set to 0.25.

    train_size : float, int, or None, (default=None)
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
        proportion of the dataset to include in the train split. If
        int, represents the absolute number of train samples. If None,
        the value is automatically set to the complement of the test size.

    Returns
    -------
    splitting : list, length=2 * len(arrays)
        List containing train-test split of inputs.

    >>> y_train, y_test = train_test_split(y, test_size=50)
