        "\n# Seasonal decomposition of your time-series\n\n\nThis example demonstrates how we can use the ``decompose`` function to extract\nthe trend, seasonal, and random components of the time series and then\nplot them all using the ``decomposed_plot`` function. We'll be plotting both\n``additive`` and ``multiplicative`` examples of seasonality. To see the R\nequivalent that inspired this example go [here](https://anomaly.io/seasonal-trend-decomposition-in-r/index.html).\n\n.. raw:: html\n\n   <br/>\n"

We then take the\n#    mean across all seasons to get the values for a single season. For m=4, we\n#    expect 4 values for a single season.\n# 3) We then create the seasonal series by replicating the single season\n#    until it is the same length of the trend signal.\n# 4) Lastly to get the random/noise elements of the signal we remove the effects\n#    of both the trend and seasonal series and we are now left with the\n#    variation of the original signal that is neither explainable by seasonal\n#    nor trend effects.\n#\n# This logic produces a named tuple of the original signal, trend, seasonal,\n# and random components.
