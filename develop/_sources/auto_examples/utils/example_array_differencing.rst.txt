==================
Array differencing
==================


In this example, we demonstrate pyramid's array differencing, and how it's used
in conjunction with the ``d`` term to lag a time series.

    from pmdarima.utils import array

    # Build an array and show first order differencing results
    x = array.c(10, 4, 2, 9, 34)
    lag_1 = array.diff(x, lag=1, differences=1)

    # The result will be the same as: x[1:] - x[:-1]
    print(lag_1)  # [-6., -2., 7., 25.]

    # Note that lag and differences are not the same! If we crank diff up by one,
    # it performs the same differencing as above TWICE. Lag, therefore, controls
    # the number of steps backward the ts looks when it differences, and the
    # `differences` parameter controls how many times to repeat.
    print(array.diff(x, lag=1, differences=2))  # [4., 9., 18.]

    # Conversely, when we set lag to 2, the array looks two steps back for its
    # differencing operation (only one).
    print(array.diff(x, lag=2, differences=1))  # [-8., 5., 32.]

    # The lag parameter is controlled by `m`, which is the seasonal periodicity of
    # a time series. If your series is non-seasonal, lag will typically be 1.
