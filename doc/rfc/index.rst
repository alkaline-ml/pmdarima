=============
pmdarima RFCs
=============

An RFC, or "request for comments," is a common practice in open source packages, and
allows users and contributors to weigh in on a proposal that will fundamentally alter
the public API (usually encompassing breaking changes or design decisions). All ``pmdarima``
RFCs will be included for future users of the package to read through so that decision-making
is transparent and makes sense to all users.
